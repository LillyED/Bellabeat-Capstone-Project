For my capstone project, I conducted a data analysis of Bellabeat, a company focused on womenâ€™s wellness products. The goal was to identify patterns in user activity, sleep, and health habits to inform product improvements and boost engagement. Using R and tools like dplyr and ggplot2, I analysed Bellabeat's data, uncovering key trends and correlations. My findings led to actionable recommendations for product development and marketing strategies, demonstrating my ability to handle real-world data and generate insights.
